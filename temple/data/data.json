The Newport Beach Planning Commission gave its approval for the Newport Beach California Temple on October 3, 2002, despite protests from the numerous residents in attendance. The Church worked closely with residents in a spirit of compromise, making changes in response to their concerns that included turning off flood lighting by 11:00 p.m., changing the color of the building from off-white to an earth-tone shade of seashell, and reducing the height of the spire from 124 feet to 100 feet. Elder Duane B. Gerrard, first counselor in the North America West Area presidency, presided and dedicated the temple site",
