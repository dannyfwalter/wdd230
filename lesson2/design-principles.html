			<h2>Hick's Law - <a href="https://littlecaesars.com/en-us/">Little Caesars</a></h2>

			<img src="images/little_cesars.PNG" alt="Screenshot of Little Caesars' website">

    	<p>Little Caesars implements a great example of Hick's Law by minimizing 
				the options available to the user. Instead of making the user's first 
				decision difficult by displaying the different food items available, 
				they make the user's decision easy by making the options either 
				delivery or pickup</p>

			<h2>Proximity - <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng">Church of Jesus Christ</a></h2>

			<img src="images/church_of_jc.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the Church of Jesus Christ's website">

			<p>The Church of Jesus Christ makes it easy to navigate their website by 
				implementing the principle of proximity. Titles overlap images so that 
				users can make connections between the text and image.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Alignment - <a href="https://www.cvs.com/">CVS</a></h2>

			<img src="images/cvs_image.PNG" alt="Screenshot of CVSs website">

			<p>CVS uses alignment to connect elements. Towards the top of the page, 
				they have general information that most people will use when they 
				visit the site. The next section has vaccination information for COVID 
				and the flu. This structure makes it easy for users to find what 
				they're looking for.</p>
